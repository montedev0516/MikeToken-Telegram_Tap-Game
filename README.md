# Required Tech and Functions

Using **NodeJS, TypeScript, Telegram API, ReactJS, and MongoDB,** I implemented features such as **Airdrop, Multitap, Full Energy, Limit Energy, Invite Friends, and Rank.** These features not only enhance user engagement but also provide opportunities for users to earn rewards through airdrops and friend invitations, creating a fun and profitable experience.
